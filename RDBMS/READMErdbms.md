# ðŸšŒ Bus Management System (RDBMS)

This project implements a relational database system to manage bus operations. It covers data storage, manipulation, and reporting for buses, drivers, routes, schedules, and bookings, demonstrating practical skills in SQL and database design.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

âœ… Database Structure

- **Tables:** `Bus`, `Drivers`, `Route`, `Bookings`, `Schedule`
- Each table is linked using primary and foreign keys to maintain relationships between the tables.

âœ… Perform SQL queries for:
- Data retrieval and analysis
- Aggregations like count, average, and sum
- Filtering and sorting
- Joining tables to generate comprehensive reports

âœ… Support for advanced SQL operations:
- Grouping with `GROUP BY`
- Aggregations like `COUNT()`, `AVG()`, `MAX()`, `SUM()`
- Set operations with `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, `EXCEPT`
- String and numeric functions like `SUBSTRING()`, `ROUND()`, `UPPER()`

âœ… Generate insights such as:
- Total bookings per bus or per day
- Driver assignments and contact details
- Buses sorted by capacity or route distance
- Schedules for buses between specific cities

## ðŸ“· Example Queries

> **Get drivers for AC buses only:**
> 
SELECT D.driver_name, D.contact_number, B.bus_name
FROM Drivers D
JOIN Bus B ON D.bus_id = B.bus_id
WHERE B.bus_type = 'AC';


>**List total bookings per bus:**
>
SELECT B.bus_name, COUNT(Bo.booking_id) AS total_bookings
FROM Bus B
JOIN Bookings Bo ON B.bus_id = Bo.bus_id
GROUP BY B.bus_name;
>
>
> **Find buses with maximum capacity:**
>
SELECT * FROM Bus
WHERE capacity = (SELECT MAX(capacity) FROM Bus);
